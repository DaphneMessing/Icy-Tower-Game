This project is a creatively modified version of a classic platformer game inspired by **'Icy Tower'**. Built using **HTML5 Canvas** and **JavaScript**, it challenges players to guide a character upwards by jumping from platform to platform while avoiding enemies and collecting power-ups. With enhanced mechanics and visuals, this project demonstrates the ability to analyze, improve, and expand an existing codebase.

### Features Added

1. **Score System**: A real-time scoring mechanism to track player progress.
2. **Dynamic Platforms**:
   - Platforms come in different widths, ensuring a variety of challenges.
   - Non-overlapping platform placement for smoother gameplay.
   - 6% of platforms feature vertical movement for added complexity.
   - Special platforms divisible by 10 are labeled with their number.
3. **Power-Ups**:
   - Collectible stars grant immunity for 8 seconds, allowing players to survive enemy contact.
4. **Interactive Obstacles**:
   - Falling platforms: Platforms collapse if the player stands on them for more than 3 seconds.
   - Two enemy types: 
     - **Type 1**: Stationary threats.
     - **Type 2**: Mobile enemies patrolling platforms.
5. **Game Over Sequence**:
   - Displays a "GAME OVER" message and a "Play Again" button.
   - Features a leaderboard showing the top 10 scores.
6. **Improved Visuals**:
   - A custom background, player sprite, and images for platforms, enemies, and stars bring the game to life.
